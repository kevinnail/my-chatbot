# Gmail IMAP Alternative (No Google Cloud Required)

If you prefer to avoid Google Cloud entirely, you can use Gmail's IMAP access instead. This requires no external services or API keys.

## Prerequisites

1. Gmail account with 2-factor authentication enabled
2. Gmail App Password (not your regular password)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Gmail IMAP

1. Go to Gmail Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP
2. Enable IMAP access

### 2. Create App Password

1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Security > 2-Step Verification
3. App passwords > Select "Mail" > Generate
4. Copy the 16-character password

### 3. Environment Variables

```env
# Gmail IMAP Configuration (instead of OAuth)
GMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
GMAIL_IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
GMAIL_IMAP_PORT=993
```

### 4. Install IMAP Library

```bash
npm install imap
```

## Implementation Changes

I can modify the Gmail MCP controller to use IMAP instead of the Gmail API. This would:

✅ **Eliminate Google Cloud dependency**
✅ **Keep everything local**
✅ **Still provide full agentic analysis**
✅ **Work with your existing Ollama setup**

### Trade-offs

**IMAP Pros:**

- No external API setup
- Completely local
- No quotas or rate limits
- Works with any email provider

**IMAP Cons:**

- Less efficient than Gmail API
- Requires app password management
- No direct Gmail web links
- More complex email parsing

## Security Notes

- App passwords are safer than your main password
- IMAP uses encrypted connection (SSL/TLS)
- No OAuth tokens stored in database
- All processing still happens locally

Would you like me to implement the IMAP version instead?
